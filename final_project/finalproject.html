    <section id="history">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Borzoi's ancestry is as intriguing as the breed itself. Developed by crossing Arabian greyhounds with a thick-coated Russian breed, the Borzoi was the dog of choice for Tsars before becoming a symbol of aristocratic Russian life. They were treasured for their hunting prowess, particularly for their ability to pursue and pin large game such as wolves. This breed's history is a tapestry woven through time, reflecting its survival and adaptation through Russia's tumultuous past to the present day.</p>

        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Borzois are renowned for their distinct physical characteristics, including their lean bodies, long legs, and luxuriant fur. These sighthounds are known for their keen vision and swift, agile movements, often compared to the elegance of a ballerina. The breed's temperament is as soft as their coats, exhibiting a gentle and affectionate nature within the home while maintaining a fierce predatory instinct when on the chase.

        <h2>Care & Maintenance</h2>
        <p>While the Borzoi's coat may give the impression of a high-maintenance breed, their grooming needs are surprisingly moderate. Regular brushing to remove dead hair and minimize shedding is typically sufficient. Their exercise requirements, however, are considerable. As a breed built for speed and endurance, Borzois thrive on regular opportunities to run in safe, enclosed spaces. Nutrition is also key, with a diet rich in protein to support their lean muscle mass and energy needs. A Borzoi's health and happiness are the rewards of attentive care and understanding of their unique breed requirements.</p>
